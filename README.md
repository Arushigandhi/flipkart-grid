## Problem Statement

The objective is to replace the physical warranty and have block chain based warranty using NFT which will ensure
authenticity and security.

## Our Solution

A full stack web app that integrates functionalities for both buyers and sellers to manage their warranties and get ```Blockchain Based Warranty```. It aims to remove the need of physical warranty cards for items and demonstrates a real world application of NFTs. We strive to make the whole warranty lifecycle as smooth as possible for both the seller and the buyer. Retailers/Brands can record their sales and the customers can just enter their details and get the NFT straight to their wallet.
